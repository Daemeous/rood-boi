/* The classic look drawn in Lua (plan pc/docs/plans/2026-10-20-classic-ui-in-lua.md
 * §2): the game side's hook, under ROOD_PC only.
 *
 * PC_CLASSIC wraps the call that draws one of the game's classic elements:
 * the packets the statement allocates from the scratchpad's packet pointer
 * (0x1F800000), its place and the game's record go to pc_classic_site
 * (pc/src/classic/classic_bridge.c), which
 *   - keeps them as the kind's capture (RPC packets, the parity gate),
 *   - and, when a plugin's classic claim on the kind is honoured, turns them
 *     into no-ops and has the claim emit its own in the same ordering-table
 *     slot (emit-only suppression: the statement still runs, so whatever
 *     game state it steps is stepped as before).
 * Without a claim nothing changes: the game's own drawing is the fallback.
 * The kinds are classic_parity.h's PC_CLASSIC_* (the HUD layer's kinds keep
 * their numbers: hud_hook.h's PC_HUD is this hook). */
